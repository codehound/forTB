                <div id="semanticBox">
                <h1>What is semantic HTML?</h1><p>Semantic HTML from my understanding is the strong naming convention of tags, classes and IDs that help communicate the purpose or meaning of the defined element to browers and even to the person viewing the code.  This assists in the relationships to other elements and helps with the a who, the what and the why.</p>

                <div id="accessibilityBox">
                <h1>What is accessibility?</h1><p>Accessibility in web development is the utilization of features and functions through design that allow people with disabilities to interact with a website without a hindrance. From video closed captioning for the deaf to the use of a focused color palette to assist someone that is color blind.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="progressiveEnhancement"><h1>What is progressive enhancement?</h1><p>Progressive enhancement in my understanding, is the layering or separation of design elements in order to maintain a successful user experience from legacy to modern browsers.  For instance, having Javascript disabled on a browser will not break the site, but will provide a lesser experience to the user.</p>
